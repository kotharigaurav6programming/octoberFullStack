Structure of Java Program
-------------------------

Line 1 : class Hello
Line 2 : {
Line 3 :     public static void main(String args[])
Line 4 :     {
Line 5 :         System.out.println("Hello world");
Line 6 :     }
Line 7 : }

Line 1 Explanation : class Hello

|-- class is a keyword
|-- class is a userdefined blueprint for creating object
|-- we define class name in pascal case
|-- Hello is a userdefined class name 
|-- By convension, we keep first letter of class name in uppercase

Line 2 : {

|-- It simply represents the opening of class definition part

Line 3 : public static void main(String args[])

|-- public is a keyword
|-- It is also a access modifier(public, private, protected, default) but its mandatory to write public only here
|-- Why public ? Because JVM(Java Virtual Machine) can call it from anywhere.

|-- static is also a keyword
|-- Along with this it is a modifier (static, synchronized, abstract, final etc) but its mandatory to write static only here.
|-- If we make any method as a static, then in that case we do not needs to create object of that class to call that static method, static methods are directly called by class name. 
Note : static methods (static member functions) are class member functions.

|-- public static <return_type>
    public static void : here void means it does not return anything

|-- main : main is predefined word
|-- (String args[])
    |-- Here String is a class 
    |-- args[] is a String array name(user defined name)
    |-- String arr[] valid
    |-- String args[] represents command line arguments, which is responsible for taking arguments for main method at run time.

    Note : 
        String args[], here args is an array
        String []args, here args is an array
        String[] args, here args is an array
        String...args, here args is an array
        |-- three dots represents varargs (variable arguments)

    Note:
        String name[],salary;
            here name is an array and salary is a variable   
        String []name,salary;
            here name is an array and salary is a variable   
        String[] name,salary;
            here name and salary both are array   

Line 4 : {

|-- It simply represents the opening of main function definition part
