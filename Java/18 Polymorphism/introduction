Polymorphism
------------
1. Compile time Polymorphism
    or Early Binding
    or Static Binding

   Method Overloading(Function Overloading) 
    |-- same name function with different no. of arguments or
        with same no. of arguments but with different datatypes.
    |-- lies in same class
    |-- No inherit mechanism is there.

2. Run time Polymorphism
    or Late Binding
    or Dynamic Binding

   Method Overriding(Function Overriding) 
    |-- same name function with same no. of arguments.
    |-- lies in different classes
    |-- Inherit mechanism is must.
