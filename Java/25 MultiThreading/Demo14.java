Thread Synchronization : 
------------------------
Synchronization is the process in which multiple threads can shares shared resources one by one. 
Thread synchronization can be classified as : 
    a. Mutual exclusive
        |-- Synchronized block (object level locking)
        |-- Synchronized method (object level locking) 
        |-- static synchronization (class level locking)

    b. Inter Thread communication (Co-Operation of Thread)
        |-- wait(), notify() and notifyAll()
