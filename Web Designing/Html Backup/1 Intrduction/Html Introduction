HyperText : HyperText is a text which contains link to another text.
Markup Language : Tag(<>) based language
  |-- Works on three terminology
        |-- Definition
        |-- Processing
        |-- Presentation

|-- Html document consists of Multi media content(Images,animation,audio,video etc)

|-- Output of Html document is going to be displayed out on browser screen.

|-- We can create html document on any word processing tool(wordpad, notepad, vs code(editor), sublime text, dreamviewer (designing tool)etc).

|-- We need to save html document by .html or .htm extension

|-- Html also works on three terminology : 
    |-- Tag
          |-- Tags are hidden keywords, which are mainly used to display content on browser screen.There are different types of tags : 
            |-- a. Empty Tag (Unbalanced Tag)
                   Only opening takes place and no closing Tag here.
                   Ex : <br>,<hr>,<input> etc 
            |-- b. Container Tag (Balanced Tag)
                   Opening and Closing both are involved here.
                   Ex : <html>
                    ......
                   </html>,
                   <title></title>, <head></head> etc 
            |-- c. Self enclosing Tag
                   Mainly used in React
                   Ex : <br/>, <hr/> , <input /> etc
            |-- d. Semantic Tag
                   Tag which shows meaning by its name
                   Ex : <header></header>,
                        <footer></footer>,
                        <section></section> etc 
            |-- e. Non-semantic Tag(Structural Tag)
                   Tag which shows generalized meaning by its name
                   Ex : <form></form>,
                        <div></div> etc 

    |-- Attribute
        |-- Attribute provides some additional information
        <img src="" height="" width="">
        <p align="center">
        here src, height , width, align are attributes.

    |-- Element 
        |-- Html is an element, which represents whole document and it comprises of opening of <html> tag and closing of </html> tag.
        |-- Body is also an element, which represents document's body and it comprises of opening of <body> tag and closing of </body> tag.
