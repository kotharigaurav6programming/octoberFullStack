<!Doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title></title>
        <style>
        Here we use the concept of Selectors, which represents that which property corresponding to its value is going to be implemented on which element. Types of selectors : 
                 1. Element Selector or Tag Selector 
                 2. Id selector 
                 3. Class Selector 
                 4. Grouping selector 
                 5. Descendant selector 
                 6. Universal selector 
                 7. Pseudo class selector 
                 8. Pseudo element selector
                 9. Advance selector 
                    a. nth-of-type selector 
                    b. Attribute selector 
                    c. Adjacent sibling selector 
                    d. General sibling selector 
                    e. Direct child selector 
        On the basis of these selectors, we are going to implement properties corresponding to its value to elements .                
            property : value;
            property : value;
             |            |
            property : value; 
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div></div>
        <p></p>
        <span></span>
    </body>
</html>
